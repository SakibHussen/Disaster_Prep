# Disaster Preparedness AI Application

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered Disaster Preparedness Assessment Tool designed to help users evaluate their readiness for natural disasters based on selected survival items and their geographic location. The application utilizes AI analysis, Google Maps API for geolocation, and Google Translate API for multilingual support.

## Features
- üìç **Location-Based Risk Assessment**: Users' risk levels are determined based on their latitude and longitude.
- üéØ **Personalized Preparedness Score**: Calculates preparedness scores based on selected survival items and disaster risk levels.
- üìù **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze user preparedness and provide improvement suggestions.
- üåç **Multilingual Support**: Google Translate API enables translation of AI analysis into multiple languages.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Google Maps Integration**: Displays user location on an interactive map.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **APIs**:
  - Google Maps API
  - Google Translate API
  - Gemini AI API
- **Hosting**: Local development for submission
